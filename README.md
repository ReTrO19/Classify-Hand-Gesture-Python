## **Description**

This projects helps in classification of Hand Gestures using OpenCV.

<font size="4"> **Use cases of this project**</font>

Gestures play an important role in our everyday communication and expression. Thus using them to communicate with tech devices needs very little intellectual data processing from our side. That means we can control different things such as vending machines almost without thinking, just by using our fingers and hands

Times have changed and so did the customer preferences. Nowadays, more and more people don't want to use touchscreens. Many of us think it's unhygienic to use a touchscreen of a public device such as an informational table, especially in times of the pandemic.


#### **Technologies**
